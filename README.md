# Radio-Data-System
MATLAB implementation of RDS protocol.

Run main_rds.m (script file) to see output. 
Necessary documentation is inside main_rds.m as well as in all functions


Output graphs are in the folder 'Graphs'


Data for the noise analysis (for SNR from 100 to 1) are stored in the folder 'Noise analysis data'


Data recovery was not completed in Simulink. Only tranmsission and demodulation work. 
Modifications need to be done in the sampling time and configurations for RDS recovery.
